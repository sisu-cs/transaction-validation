# Transaction Validation Tool

Tool used to validate client submitted transaction template files.

When using the .command file, if you are promted with a permission error, run

```chmod u+x "path_to_file"``` replace "path to file", quotations included, with the absolute path to the file. On mac, right click and when the pop-up appears hold the **option** key and the option to copy as pathname will appear. Clicking this will copy the path to your clipboard. 

This will give the file permission to run.
